We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy new Year

Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding
And a cup of good cheer

Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy new Year

We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
So bring some out here

Good tidings we bring
To you and your kin
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy new Year

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
